# Instructions
The PDFs should be saved the "data" folder.
<br>
Install all the python required packages before running the "ingest" and the "chatbot" files.
<br>
You have to put your API key in the ".env" file. You need to login to the OpenAI Platform to get an API key.
<br>
Make sure to put the correct document file path in the "ingest" document.
<br>
The collection name and the persist directory on the "ingest" file should match the ones that are on the "chatbot" file.
